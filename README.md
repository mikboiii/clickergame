# clickergame - name pending
This is the repo containing a side project produced by Mikolaj Greszta, for use as a portfolio project and maintain practice

## To do list:
- [x] Create prototype for clicking and resource generation
- [ ] Make nicer UI
- [ ] Add purchasable items requiring more than one resource
- [ ] Give workers more agency/life
- [ ] Add additional mechanic to supplement clicking (IE expeditions or rpg style choices)

## ideas
- have expedition/dungeon crawling mechanic where enemies and traps are faced with treasure at the end?
- change the resources to one resource which is xp but can purchase other "currencies"?
